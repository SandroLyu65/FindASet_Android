## About the Game

Set (stylized as SET) is a real-time card game designed by Marsha Falco in 1974 and published by Set Enterprises in 1991. 
The deck consists of 81 unique cards that vary in four features across three possibilities for each kind of feature: number of shapes (one, two, or three),
shape (diamond, squiggle, oval), shading (solid, striped, or open), and color (red, green, or purple).[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(card_game))

In the game, certain combinations of three cards are said to make up a set. For each one of the four categories of features — 
color, number, shape, and shading — the three cards must display that feature as either a) all the same, or b) all different. 
Put another way: the number of features that are all the same and the number of features that are all different may break down as 0 the same + 4 different;
or 1 the same + 3 different; or 2 the same + 2 different; or 3 the same + 1 different.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(card_game))

The aim of our project is to create an Android app implementation of Set game.

The current version of this app includes:

* Register and login 
* Ranking with other users scores 
* Different playing modes:
	* Learning
	* Find 10 sets
	* Find all sets    

## Description
An in-depth paragraph about your software structure, android versions supported etc.

### Code
	• Use a Model: create classes that implement a single abstraction and use instances all over your
	app (see: “Android Tutorial refactoring”); provide the UML diagram of your model
	• Make use of the Java and Android API documentation; finding your way through the
	documentation is one of the goals of this course
	• Choose the right collections
	• Make use of lambda expressions
	• Apply clean code principles: naming of classes, methods and variables should be as selfexplanatory as possible, find and apply design patterns, refactor 	your code (small methods,
	small classes, …) often
	• If possible, add something ”special” or “new” (in the sense of: “something where we did not
	offer an introduction for”) in your app (for instance: a map, an API that makes use of specific
	hardware in your mobile device, ...)
### Database
